## How it works:

1.	The current version of the Champion Management Platform operates as an app in Microsoft Teams that is installed locally in your tenant by your tenant administrator or any user who has the capability to side load the application.
2.  Once installed, it can be accessed via “+Add a tab”  option at the top of the channel within a team. ***Channel > Add a tab > Champion Management Platform***
3.	The app installation process will create a SharePoint list (***Members List*** )to store all users who are nominated to be a champion. A local administrator is responsible for maintaining this SharePoint list. This person can be the individual who manages the Champion program for the organization or his/her delegate.
4.	The app provides an easy interface for approved employees (Champions) to showcase their Focus area, preview, collaborate and even add their colleagues as new champions.
5.	There are 3 major components in Champion Management Platform. 
..a.	Champion management
..b.	Leaderboard 
..c.	Digital badging
6.	The Champions will be earning points for hosting events, writing Blogs, moderating Office hours etc., Leaderboard ranks all the champions based on their points globally, regionally, and even by focus area.
7.	Point accumulation , ranking logic, Event details are configurable by the Admin based on the organization  needs. <br/>

### Champion Leaderboard:

Leaderboard solution is intended to add a gaming aspect to the Teams Champions program by allowing champions to earn points for the various ways they are promoting and supporting the internal adoption of their areas of interest. This also gives an opportunity to reflect their activity in comparison to other champs. Leaderboard has mainly 2 different views based on the role of that employee.
Roles can be categorized as: 
* i.	Admin/Moderator OR Champion
* ii.	Employee 


### Admin/Moderator OR Champion view
In our Champions program, Admin is a Champion by default.  The Champion view is to enable Administrator or Champions to identify all the members of the Champions program.

### Additional Customization Options

The Champion Management Platform is built to provide a great starting point for managing your program. There are several ways you can modify the solution to fit your needs, with some of teh major customizations in this current release coming from modifying list and column options once the solution has been deployed. Common actions include:

. Expanding the list of regions / countries / Focus Area / Groups to fit your criteria. Lists provide a very flexible way to provide data points for collection. While we have provided some starter data you will want to modify these values as they are reflected in the Add Members section. This action is done from selecting the list you would like to edit (champion list for this example), selecting the drop down on the column, then navigating to Column settings -> Edit.
<br/>

<img src="./Images/customization.png" alt="Quick Start Guide" style="width: 100%;">

. You could take similar actions in other lists to modify or add in event types and manual counts for activity logging.
